## 1. Executive Summary  

Meta Platforms (META) remains the world’s largest social‑media conglomerate, with a diversified portfolio that includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus Quest, and a rapidly expanding Reality Labs division. In FY 2024 the company generated **$38.7 B** in revenue, a **+18 %** year‑over‑year increase, driven primarily by advertising but bolstered by emerging metaverse and AI products.  

Key highlights:  

| Metric | FY 2024 | YoY | FY 2023 |
|--------|---------|-----|---------|
| **Revenue** | $38.7 B | +18 % | $32.5 B |

Meta’s core ad business remains robust, yet user growth has decelerated to single‑digit percentages, reflecting market saturation and regulatory scrutiny. The company is aggressively investing in Reality Labs and generative AI to diversify revenue streams and secure a long‑term competitive edge. Regulatory risks, especially in the EU and US, continue to pose a significant threat, but proactive compliance and transparent data practices are mitigating these exposures.  

**Strategic outlook:** Meta projects a **>15 %** revenue CAGR through 2028, with the metaverse expected to contribute ~12 % of total revenue by 2028. Success hinges on accelerated product innovation, regulatory cooperation, and a renewed focus on user experience and privacy.
